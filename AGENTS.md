# Next.js: ALWAYS read docs before coding

Before any Next.js work, find and read the relevant doc in `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Your training data is outdated — the docs are the source of truth.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Personal Accounts**: `auth.users.id = accounts.id`
- **Team Accounts**: Shared workspaces with members, roles, permissions
- Data links to accounts via `account_id` foreign key
- **Routes address a team by `slug`; mutations take the immutable `accountId`.**
  Slugs are user-editable and reusable, so a slug captured when a form rendered
  can point at a different team by the time it is submitted. Details and the
  reason a client-supplied id is safe: `packages/next/AGENTS.md`.
- Personal accounts have no membership row, so `has_role_on_account()` is false
  for them. A table whose policies use only that helper is team-only — which is
  usually what you want, but decide it deliberately.

## Key Patterns (Quick Reference)

| Pattern        | Import                                                       | Details                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Server Actions | `authActionClient` from `@kit/next/safe-action`              | `packages/next/AGENTS.md`     |
| Route Handlers | `enhanceRouteHandler` from `@kit/next/routes`                | `packages/next/AGENTS.md`     |
| Server Client  | `getSupabaseServerClient` from `@kit/supabase/server-client` | `packages/supabase/AGENTS.md` |
| UI Components  | `@kit/ui/{component}`                                        | `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`       |
| Translations   | `Trans` from `@kit/ui/trans`                                 | `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`       |

## Authorization

- **RLS enforces access control** - no manual auth checks needed with standard client
- **Admin client** (`getSupabaseServerAdminClient`) bypasses RLS - use sparingly with manual validation


## TypeScript

- Infer types implicitly - avoid explicit return types
- Never use `any` unless required and justified
- Use service pattern for server-side APIs
- Add `import 'server-only';` to server-only code (except if using 'use server') (not needed in components)
- Never mix client/server imports - use separate package.json exports

## React

- Always use `react-hook-form` and `@kit/ui/form` for forms
- Always use 'use client' directive for client components
- Add `data-test` for E2E tests where appropriate (Playwright's `testIdAttribute`)
- Avoid `useEffect` - justify if necessary
- Prefer single state object over multiple `useState`
- Prefer RSC for data fetching
- Display `Spinner` (from `@kit/ui/spinner`) where appropriate

## Next.js

- Use `next-safe-action` for Server Actions
- Use `authActionClient` (from `@kit/next/safe-action`) to protect actions; compose extra checks via `next-safe-action`'s `.use()` middleware
- Add page metadata to pages
- Use `redirect` after server actions (avoid client router)
  - Exception: an action that ends the auth session (e.g. deleting the account)
    returns instead, and the client does `window.location.assign(...)` in
    `onSuccess`. A server `redirect` is a soft navigation that keeps the
    browser's cached user, so the UI still renders the session as signed in.

## Verification

After implementation, always run:

1. `pnpm typecheck`
2. `pnpm lint:fix`
3. `pnpm format:fix`
4. Run adversarial reviewer skill /reviewer
5. **If the change touched RLS or the database schema** — any policy, grant, `SECURITY DEFINER` function, view, migration, or file under `apps/web/supabase/` — also run the deep adversarial RLS review skill /rls-review to prove tenant isolation with pgTAP before merging.
6. Use available **Skills** when relevant. If unavailable, continue with local `AGENTS.md`, source, tests, and package exports.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
